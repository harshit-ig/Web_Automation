SOME PROBLEMS I FACED DURING THIS PROJECT OF MINE XD 

1) Didn't use proxies because they were out of buget and well public proxies are good for nothing. So instead of proxies i used tor ip changer(search on google for more info on that) basically with that we can change our ip address with a fixed interval of time.
2) Then there was Cloudflare, well that was easy to bypass using Privacy Pass xd.
3) Also the Website used captcha but that was again easily tackled by pytesseract.
4) There was one last problem and that was what could be considered a side effect of using tor ip changer. So basically due to bad connection speed of some ips the main automation was crashing every now and then, so to fix this i created a python program runforever that is basically a loop that restarts the main automation whenever it crashes, rest you can check the code yourself to understand.
