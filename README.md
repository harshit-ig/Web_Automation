SOME PROBLEMS I FACED DURING THIS PROJECT OF MINE XD 

1) Didn't use proxies because they were out of buget and well public proxies are good for nothing. So instead of proxies i used tor ip changer(search on google for more info on that) basically with that we can change our ip address with a fixed interval of time.
2) Then there was Cloudflare, well that was easy to bypass using Privacy Pass xd.
3) Also the Website used captcha but that was again easily tackled by pytesseract.
